# Information about me

I'm Margaux Gaillard, a french PhD student and my project is named "**Development of security inks with integrated coding for the protection of cultural goods**".

I'm working under the co-direction of **Jérôme Plain** and **Julien Proust** within the **L2n laboratory** (Light nanomaterials and nanotechnology) an internal laboratory of the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT) and CNRS (UMR 7076).

# Mobility

- Participation in consortium meetings of the NOSE project at the Ecole Supérieure de la Police (ESP) in Lyon and at the Maison des Fouilles of HiSoMa archeologists in Larnaca (CYP).
  

# Formations

- Scientific and professional trainings proposed by the doctoral school:
  - Elaboration and multi-scale characterization of materials (Thin film deposition, AFM, SEM, Clean room & Chemistry Room training);
  - Nano-optics and photonics (LASER training, Nano-optics, Spectroscopy);
  - Scientific information and communication (Methods for scientific and technical communication, Methods for oral presentations in English);
  - Entrepreneurial culture (Social dialogue and Project management);
  - Ethics and scientific integrity (General introduction, Seminars and MOOC);
  - Interdisciplinary methods and tools (LaTeX advanced use and graphics library).
    

- Scientific training beside the doctoral school:
  - Labo 1.5 doctoral course: "Environmental crises: the role and positioning of research";
  - "Gènes sans gêne" (MOOC about Genes and DNA);
  - Open CV Bootcamp (MOOC about how to use the Open CV library in Python).
    

-  Professoral training:
      - Competencies for Higher Education (General Aspects, Elements of Teaching Activity).


# Pedagogical activity
